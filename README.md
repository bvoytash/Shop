Django REST App. 
Python Junior Task.
Create an online store REST API with Django-rest-framework. Implement CRUD endpoints for the following models. List GET endpoints should be paginated. 
All endpoints should return JSON. Showcase your DRF knowledge of Viewsets, Serializers and Filtering.
The response should contain a report with the monthly sales distribution for the selected period between date_start and date_end. 
If metric == “price” the value field should contain the total sum of all sold products in this month. If metric == “count” the value field should contain the total count of all sold products in this month. Example API call: /api/stats?date_start=2022-01-01&date_end=2022-08-01&metric=price
Bonus objective:
Setup Django-admin for the models and Swagger for the endpoints.
